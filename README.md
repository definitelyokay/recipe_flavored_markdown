Have you ever wanted a simpler approach to writing and maintaining recipes? Are you tired of fidgeting with apps that make it hard to specify ingredients or instructions for all your tasty, sacred texts? Would you rather take matters into your own hands and write recipes using nothing but a plain-text editor?

Meet Recipe-Flavored Markdown! Using nothing but Markdown, you can write your tasty tomes down in a loosely-opinionated way that reads almost exactly like normal recipes. Better yet, this package allows you to parse recipe-flavored markdown documents in Dart and use them however you like!

Below is what a recipe for Cinnamon Rolls might look like in recipe-flavored markdown:

Made from scratch, these soft, creamy cinnamon rolls will leave you feeling happy and satisfied, even on the coldest winter nights. Pour over a generous, sugary glaze for the warm, comforting snack you know you deserve!

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 2 cups all-purpose [flour]
- 2 tbsp [white sugar]
- 2 tsp [baking powder]
- 1 tsp [salt]
- 3 tbsp [butter], softened
- 3/4 cup [milk]
- 1 [egg]

### Filling

- 1/2 cup [white sugar]
- 1/2 cup [brown sugar]
- 1 tbsp [ground cinnamon]

### Cream Cheese Frosting

- 1 cup [powdered sugar]
- 4 oz [cream cheese], softened
- 1/4 cup [butter], softened
- 1/2 tsp [vanilla extract]

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Brush a [9" baking dish] with 2 tbsp [butter].

2. Whisk [flour], 2 tbsp [white sugar], [baking powder], and [salt] together in a large bowl.

3. Work 3 tbsp softened [butter] into [flour] mixture using your hands. Beat [milk] and [egg] together in another bowl; pour into flour-butter mixture and stir with a spatula until a soft dough forms.

4. Whisk 1/2 cup [white sugar], [brown sugar], and [cinnamon] together in a small bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the cinnamon sugar mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking dish.

Sprinkle remaining cinnamon sugar over butter-brushed dough. Roll dough around filling to form a log; cut log into 18 rolls and place rolls in the prepared baking dish.

5. Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are set, 20 to 25 minutes.

6. Beat [powdered sugar], [cream cheese], 1/4 cup softened [butter], and [vanilla extract] together in a bowl until frosting is smooth. Top hot cinnamon rolls with cream cheese frosting.

## About

Recipe-flavored markdown builds on Dart's [markdown] package by extending the syntax for markdown. When it encounters quantities, written as plain text like `1 3/4 cups`, it instructs the markdown parser to create a `Quantity` node instead of a normal text node, allowing you to walk the abstract syntax tree and immediately recognize quantities.

Recipe-writers can also specify ingredients using unresolved links, like `[tomato paste]` or `[squash]`. These unresolved links are converted to `Reference` nodes which allow you to resolve them to ingredients, cooking supplies, or other recipes within your application.
